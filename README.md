# Java Game Project ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Java Game** project! This repository contains a 2D game built entirely in Java without the use of a game engine. It's an educational journey to explore Java's core features, understand game development fundamentals, and enhance programming skills.

## ðŸ›  Project Overview
- **Technologies Used:** Java, Swing/AWT (for graphics), custom game loops, and more.
- **Development Environment:** Developed using a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
- **Tutorial Reference:** Inspired by [RyiSnow's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow).

## ðŸŽ® Features (Planned/Implemented)
- **Tile-based world:** Procedurally generated world map.
- **Entity system:** Player, enemies, and interactive objects.
- **Collision detection:** Smooth player-object interactions.
- **Custom sprites:** Load and display characters and environment elements.
- **Game mechanics:** Movement, health system, and environmental interactions.
